# Active Directory Attack Detection and Analysis with Splunk SIEM

## Objective

The Active Directory/Splunk Detection Lab project aimed to design and establish a controlled, realistic environment for simulating and detecting cyber attacks and then analyzing the resulting telemetry using a Security Information and Event Management (SIEM) platform. The primary focus was to ingest and analyze logs within a SIEM system, generating test telemetry to mimic real world attack scenarios. This hands on experience was designed to deepen my understanding of Windows security logging, attack patterns, attack detection workflows commonly used by Security Operations Centers (SOC).

### Skills Learned

- Advanced understanding of SIEM deployment, concepts and practical application.
- Virtualized network design and resource optimization.
- Proficiency in analyzing and interpreting logs.
- Ability to generate and recognize attack signatures and patterns.
- Development of critical thinking and problem solving skills in cybersecurity.

### Tools Used

- **VirtualBox:** Virtualization platform used to host and manage lab virtual machines.
- **Windows Server 2022 Active Directory Domain Services:** Centralized identity management and authentication infrastructure.
- **Windows 10:** Domain joined endpoint used to simulate user activity and attack targets.
- **Kali Linux:** Attack simulation platform for telemetry generation to create realistic logging and attack scenarios.
- **Ubuntu Splunk Enterprise Server:** SIEM platform used to ingest, index, and analyze Windows security telemetry
- **Splunk Universal Forwarder:** Log collection agent configured on Windows systems to forward Security, System, Application, and Sysmon logs.
